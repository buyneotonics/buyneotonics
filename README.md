**[Neotonics](https://groups.google.com/g/neotonics-transforming-industries-and-lives/c/9iindL52MAQ) working: How does it enhance gut and skin health?**

Neotonics works by addressing the root cause of aging skin. Cell turnover is the process in our body that produces and replaces cells. They are responsible for replacing dead skin cells with younger new cells that make our skin healthy and young, free of wrinkles and fine lines. This cellular turnover is controlled by a microbiome and nutrient absorption in the gut. Over time when we age, the gut functions start to slow down which results in slower cellular turnover. When there is a decline in cell turnover, our skin starts aging, and wrinkles, fine lines, sagging, etc. start appearing.

Neotonics gummies have a formula to support gut health, which ultimately leads to improved cellular turnover. This [**Neotonics**](https://www.facebook.com/100090768139024/videos/1724948414672821/) skin and gut health supplement helps to attain healthy, young skin using only natural ingredients.
